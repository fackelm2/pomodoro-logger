## command line tool to write pomodoro timer in text file (log file)
A simple command-line tool because i needed a fast solution for a pomodoro timer. <br>
So I used the python loggging mechanismen to write the pomodoro timer in a log file.<br>

You can change the number of rounds, the focus time (minutes) and the break time (minutes) by changing the following constants in the python script in the main() part:

'''
pomorounds = 4          # set number of pomodoro rounds ..
pomofocustime = 30      # set minutes to focus
pomobreaktime = 5       # set minutes for break time
'''
